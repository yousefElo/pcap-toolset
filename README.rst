pcap-toolset
============

Swiss army knife for useful scripts dealing with RAN and Core
Network problems. These scripts were created to identify packet
issues on GPRS-NS and then more scripts were added to it.

The most useful might be the flatten_sctp.py that will split
an ethernet frame with multiple SCTP data chunks into having
one chunk per ethernet frame. This will make it more easy to
filter for a specific IMSI/GT.

INSTALL
=======

The scripts require python2.7 and the wonderful scapy library.
It can be easily installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt


flatten_sctp.py
===============

Filtering in wireshark for a MSISDN/GT/IMSI but spending too
much time in expanding all to actually find the TCAP/MAP section
you actually want to see? This script allows you to split separate
SCTP data chunks into single SCTP packages. This way your wireshark
filter will only show a single message. The script doesn't create
SACKs and as such wireshark will report packet loss, don't be mislead
by that.

.. code-block:: bash

for a floder a pcap files :
    python flatten_sctp.py -folder folderpath

for a single pcap file :
    python flatten_sctp.py -file folderpath

this scripte will create a new folder "_processed" and put output pcap files inside.
